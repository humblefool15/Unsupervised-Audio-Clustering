# Unsupervised-Audio-Clustering
Identifying acoustic events from a continuously streaming audio source is of interest for many applications including environmental monitoring for basic research. In this scenario neither different event classes are known nor what distinguishes one class from another. Therefore, an unsupervised feature learning method for exploration of audio data is presented in this repository
Every music file is basically made up of two important things, the sample rate, and the sample data. This has been beautifully described here in thes two videos. I am no expert on audio signals hence if you wish to know more on the subject, I would suggest you go though these videos. For our purpose, it is totally optional.
